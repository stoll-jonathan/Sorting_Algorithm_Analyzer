### Overview
This program generates 3 sets of random integer values in the range of 0 to 1,000,000 and sorts them twice (so each sorting algorithm can be tested on both unsorted and sorted data). The number sets are of sizes:
1. 1,000
2. 10,000
3. 100,000.

### Sorting Algorithms
This program implements and analyzes the performance of three sorting algorithms:  
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Merge Sort

### Data Analysis
Each algorithm sorts the datasets twenty times each (ten for unsorted and another ten for sorted) for a total of 60 executions per algorithm.

The following metrics are tracked and saved in both spreadsheet and line graph formats:
1. CPU time
2. Number of comparisons
3. Number of swaps
